# Pugh Matrix Application

The Pugh Matrix Application is a tool designed to facilitate decision-making processes by comparing various solutions against established criteria using a structured approach. This tool helps shift decision-making from subjective impressions to a more objective, data-focused strategy.

## Compatibility

This software is compatible on windows only.

## Antivirus Warning

When downloading or executing the Pugh Matrix Application, your antivirus software may flag the executable file as a potential threat. This is a common issue with applications not recognized in the antivirus's database, particularly for software downloaded directly from the Internet without a digital signature.

I have created this application as a hobby project in my spare time. I did not purchase any Code Signing Certificate to prevent any potential issues with firewalls. That comes with a monthly cost, which I'm frankly not interested in having for a free-to-use software. Hope you'll see pass this and enjoy the application.
